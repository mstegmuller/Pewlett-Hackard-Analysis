# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

 Overview of Analysis
 
The purpose of the analysis was to create tables showing the employees of Pewlett Hackard position titles.  I also had to create tables showing employees who are retiring and employees who were eligible for a mentorship.  In the tables made we had to use information such as first and last name, start date and end date with the company and employee numbers.   

Results 

1.)	One-Third of the retirees in the company are senior engineers.  Another third of the retirees are the senior staff.  
2.)	Since these senior staff and engineers have the highest number of retirees the company will have a high urgency to replace these positions. 
3.)	There are 1549 employees who are retiring who are in the mentorship program.
4.)	There are more people retiring than the company has mentors.  The company will have to have a large hiring and trading program or use technology to replace the retirees.  

Summary

To determine how many roles will be needed to fill the silver tsunami you would need to create a table showing the retires by age.  Since we have a list of people born from 1952 to 1955 the company can calculate the amount of people retiring and hire the proper amount to offset the retirees.
There are not enough qualified retirement ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of employees.  Using the same retirement table, the company will need to qualify employees for the mentorship program and how many they will need.
